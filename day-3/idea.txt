Algorithm idea

The overall algorithm consists of iterating through each line of the input (each representing a rucksack).

1) Read a line of input: Get the string representing the contents of a single rucksack.

2) Split the string: Divide the string into two equal halves. 
   The first half is the content of the first compartment, and the second half is the content of the second compartment.

3) Find the common character:
    - convert one of the compartment strings into a set or a hash map for quick lookups
    - iterate through the characters of the second compartment
    - for each character, check if it exists in the set created from the first compartment

The first character we find that is also in the set is the one we're looking for. 
Since the problem guarantees there is exactly one common item, we can stop searching as soon as we find it.

4) Calculate the priority: Check if the common character is lowercase or uppercase.
    - If it's lowercase, its priority is its position in the alphabet plus 1 
      (e.g., 'a' is at position 0, so priority is 0+1=1; 'b' is at position 1, so priority is 1+1=2, etc.) - ASCII
    - If it's uppercase, its priority is its position in the alphabet plus 27 
      (e.g., 'A' is at position 0, so priority is 0+27=27; 'B' is at position 1, so priority is 1+27=28, etc.) - ASCII

5) Accumulate the sum: Add the calculated priority to a running total.

6) Repeat: Continue this process for all lines in the input file.

7) Final result: The final running total (sum) is the answer.
